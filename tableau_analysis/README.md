## Summary of Insights
### Product Orders:
- At the start of the pandemic, Airpods had a significant spike and record-high total ordesr at 1,327. However, Gaming Monitors and Macbook Air outperformed Airpods in total sales. This spike then significantly decreased and slowed throughout the rest of 2020 through 2022. 
- All orders and sales have completely dropped off at the end of March 2022 - investigate whether there is an issue with the products or marketing or a new competitor for this market.

### Product Refunds:
- In 2020 Airpods saw a significant spike in total refunds. However, the Macbook Air was the third most refunded product, costs Elist a record high of 22k of total refund costs in September 2020.

### Regional Sales:
- During the peak-COVID months in early 2020, North America made up just over half of monthly sales, and most of the spike in email marketing channels was contained to this region. 

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Investigate why all product sales exhibit a steep dip in September and expand this analysis to include more years to examine whether this trend is COVID-related or consistent across time. Is there a product feature we can implement to combat this dip?
- While regional trends have remained relatively consistent, EMEA showed positive resistance to market trends in March 2021 - investigate variables that increased sales in this region while all other regions decreased.
