## Summary of Insights
### Plan Type:
- At the start of the pandemic, Enterprise plans had a significant spike and record-high at $226K bookings in one week. This spike then significantly decreased and slowed in both summer of 2020 and summer of 2021. 
- Business plans have completely dropped off at the end of 2021 - investigate whether there is an issue with the product or a new competitor for this market.

### Plan Period:
- Yearly plans make up over 90% of bookings, but have exhibited a significant drop-off towards the end of 2021 that was not seen in monthly plans.

### Plan Region:
- During the peak-COVID months in early 2020, North America made up almost two thirds of weekly bookings, and most of the spike in enterprise was contained to this region. 

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Investigate why Enterprise plans exhibit a steep dip in summer months and expand this analysis to include more years to examine whether this trend is COVID-related or consistent across time. Is there a product feature we can implement to combat this dip?
- Yearly plans have an outsized-impact on bookings, so consider adding trials or promotions to improve the dip in yearly plans.
- While regional trends have remained relatively consistent, EMEA shows the most volatility - investigate whether there are features or promos to help make this region more stable.
