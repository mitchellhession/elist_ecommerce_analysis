# **Elist Sales Analysis**

Elist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics to customers around the world. In this portfolio project, I analyzed a dataset composed or real world data, randomly generated data, and AI generated data, to investigate trends and growth rates in revenue, average order value, product popularity, marketing channels, and refund rates to surface insights on overall company performance. I also investigated the effectiveness of their recently launched loyalty program to give recommendations on the continuation of the program. 

I used SQL, Dashboards, Stories, Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, aggregation functions, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize the insights below, to be delivered to the finance and product team. 

# Summary of Insights
**Yearly Trends:** From 2019 to 2022, the average annual sales reached 21K orders with a yearly revenue of $5 million and an average order value of $227. Notably, 2021 had the highest number of sales (36,000), while 2020 exhibited the highest average order value ($300). 

**Seasonality:** Spring and winter months tend to have higher sales, possibly due to holiday gift-buying and promotions, and there was a spike in average sale price in January and February 2020, possibly related to pandemic purchases. 

**Products:** Apple Airpods Headphones consistently ranked as the best-selling product, and in 2022, the top three products accounted for 70% of sales, while the Bose Headphones had the lowest number of sales across most years. 

**Loyalty Program:** The team recommends continuing with the loyalty program, as these customers make more purchases on average and spend an average of $30 more in 2022 per purchase even with their program discount.

**Quarterly Trends:** Across 2019-2022, Elist sold an average of 89 Macbooks to North American customers each quarter, with average quarterly sales of $143.5K. The average order price of these Macbooks was $1600.

**Refund Trends:** The Macbook Air Laptop gets refunded the most at 4.2%. However, the Apple Airpod Headphones have the highest count of refunds, at 657 refunds across all years. The gaming monitor and Macbook Air have 395 and 118 refunds, respectively. 

**Quarterly Trends:** Across all regions, direct has the highest number of orders. However, direct is not really a marketing channel as it indicates customers coming directly to the site. After direct, email has the second-highest number of orders in each region.
