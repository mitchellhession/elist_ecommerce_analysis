# elist_ecommerce_analysis
Elist is a sample e-commerce company that sells popular electronics to customers around the world. In this portfolio project, I analyzed a sample dataset to investigate trends and growth rates in revenue, average order value, product popularity, marketing channels, and refund rates to surface insights on overall company performance. I also investigated the effectiveness of their recently launched loyalty program to give recommendations on the continuation of the program.

I used Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, aggregation functions, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize the insights below, to be delivered to the finance and product team.
